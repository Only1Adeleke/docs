To deploy on Brimble, you need to create a [Project](https://beta.brimble.io/projects). A Project groups [deployments](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) and [custom domains](/getting-started/buy-domain). Each project can receive deployments from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or the Brimble CLI.

To learn more about limits on the number of projects you can have, [see Limits](https://brimble.io/pricing).

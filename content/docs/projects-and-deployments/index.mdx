Streamline your development workflow with **Brimble's robust project and deployment management** capabilities. Designed to boost developer productivity and enable effortless scalability, Brimble empowers teams to focus on building and innovating.

### Key Concepts

#### Projects

A project in Brimble represents the application you've deployed. With support for full-stack apps, including **PHP/Laravel**, **Node.js**, and all major **JavaScript frameworks**, Brimble adapts to the complexity of your needs.

- Manage multiple projects from a single repository (e.g., a monorepo) with the flexibility to configure settings for each project through the **Brimble dashboard**.
- Use the dashboard for a centralized view to monitor your projects, manage configurations, and track performance.

#### Deployments

A deployment is the output of a successful build of your project. Deployments in Brimble are seamless, triggered when you:

1. Import an existing project or template.
2. Push a Git commit via a connected integration.
3. Use the `<code>brimble deploy</code>` command in the CLI.

Every deployment is automatically assigned a unique URL, enabling instant previews, testing, and sharing.

### Next Steps

To get started:

1. **Create a New Project**: Deploy one of Brimble's templates or import and deploy an existing project.
2. **Leverage Full-Stack Support**: Explore deployment options for a range of frameworks and languages, ensuring your application scales with ease.
3. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use the dashboard to fine-tune your deployments and keep your projects running smoothly.

  <Step title="Find a Template">
    Navigate to [Brimble's Template Gallery](https://beta.brimble.io/projects/new/template) to select the perfect starting point for your project.  
    The gallery offers a variety of templates tailored to different use cases and frameworks. Use the filters to narrow down your options based on your specific requirements.

    Not sure which template to choose? We recommend starting with the popular [Next.js template](https://beta.brimble.io/projects/new/template?framework=next) to kickstart your development.

  <Step title="Connect Your Git Provider">
    To streamline updates and deployments, Brimble will create a new repository with your selected Git provider.  
    This setup ensures that every push to the repository triggers an automatic deployment, keeping your project up-to-date effortlessly.

    First, choose the Git provider you wish to connect with. After signing in, specify the scope and name for your repository. Brimble will then clone the source code into your Git account, making it easy to manage and collaborate on your project.

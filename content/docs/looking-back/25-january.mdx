## January 7

2025 is exciting year in all things. It is also the year I set out to do weekly public logs which look like this in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) as recurring task.

Year is starting off slow but there are concrete things I need to do, one of them is to release [SolBond](https://github.com/solbond/solbond).

Also I actually [published this new docs/wiki site](https://x.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1876279218763674056).

[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) is big inspiration in how much he and how he shares his work/learnings. And [brandur](https://brandur.org) is big inspiration for how to do long form writing well.

Got sick. Trying to make sense of [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org).

Worried about my dad's health. Need to work harder/smarter, and ship things that bring money.

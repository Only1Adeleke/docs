DNS (Domain Name System) is the system used to connect domain names to IP addresses. When you request a 
website, your browser performs a DNS query to find the corresponding IP address. Typically, a recursive 
resolver handles this query, checking the root DNS nameserver, the TLD (Top-Level Domain) nameserver, and the 
authoritative server if the information isn't already cached. This process ensures that your browser can 
locate and load the correct website.

    > **Tip:** If the domain doesn’t exist or is unavailable, you’ll receive a notification. Consider purchasing a new domain through Brimble or an external registrar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure DNS Records">
    Brimble will provide the necessary DNS settings, such as A Records or Nameservers. Configure these records with your domain registrar to point your domain to Brimble.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for DNS Propagation">
    DNS changes may take time to propagate depending on your registrar. Typically, this process completes within a few hours, but it can take up to 48 hours in some cases.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Your Domain">
    Once the DNS propagation is complete, you can manage your domain settings directly from the Brimble dashboard. Adjust DNS records, update configurations, or troubleshoot any issues with ease.
  </Step>
</Steps>

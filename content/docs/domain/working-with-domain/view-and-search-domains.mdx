Welcome to Brimble's guide on viewing and searching domains. Here, we'll walk you through the process of managing your registered domains directly from the Brimble dashboard.

## Viewing Domains

To access your list of registered domains, navigate to the Domains tab within your Brimble dashboard.

The domains list provides an overview of all active domains associated with your account. It includes the following columns:

- **Domain:** The domain name
- **Registrar:** The domain registrar (Brimble or Third Party)
- **Nameservers:** Nameservers for the domain (Brimble or Third Party)
- **Expiration Date:** The domain's expiration date
- **Creator:** The user who created the domain, represented by their avatar
- **Age:** The age of the domain, from its creation to the present

## Searching Domains

You can quickly locate a specific domain by utilizing the search bar located above the domains list.

Please note that searching for multi-level wildcard subdomains is not supported. The search functionality is limited to subdomains at a single level down.

With Brimble's intuitive dashboard, managing your domains has never been easier. Dive into your domain management journey today!
